    <h1>EARLY DIAGNOSIS</h1>
    <p>
        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a lifelong condition that usually appears in late infancy or early childhood<br>
        ASD has an unclear etiology and no known cure, making it difficult to acquire accurate and timely diagnoses.<br>
        In addition, once an ASD diagnosis is made, parents find it challenging to navigate the healthcare system and determine which interventions are most effective and appropriate for their child.<br>
        A growing body of evidence supports the value of early diagnosis and treatment with evidence-based interventions, which can significantly improve the quality of life of individuals with ASD as well as of their carers and families<br>
        <br>
        ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder often found in children. Approximately 9.4 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 2 and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD.
        There are three types of ADHD:
        <ul>
       <li>predominantly hyperactive-impulsive</li>
       <li>predominantly inattentive</li>
       <li>combination</li>
        </ul>
        The combined type of ADHD, where you experience both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, is the most common.
        The average age of diagnosis is 7 years old and boys are much more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls, although this may be because it presents differently.
