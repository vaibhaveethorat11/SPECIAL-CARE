    <h1 id="rside">Research On Autism</h1>
    <p id="review">A multiyear study funded by the CDC is underway to learn more about factors potentially linked to autism.
    <br><br>
    The Study to Explore Early DevelopmentTrusted Source is a collaboration between six study sites in the United States. These sites are part of the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology network and focus on children aged 2–5 years.
    <br><br>
    This ongoing research has already produced several published studies. The latest found an association between ASD and a mother’s exposure to ozone pollution during the third trimester of pregnancy.
    <br><br>
    Researchers also found that exposure to another type of air pollution called particulate matter during an infant’s first year also increased the likelihood of the infant later receiving a diagnosis of ASD.

             <p id="side">
             Pediatricians were randomly selected from four teaching hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran in 2012-13. HCW were randomly selected from 3 urban health care centers in Tehran, Iran. DSM-IV TR criteria for ASD was used to assess knowledge. Participants were asked to rate sixteen statements on beliefs about autism to assess attitude.</p> 
        <br><br>
             <h3 id="uside">Results</h3>
             <p id="side">
             Overall, 122 pediatricians and 90 HCWs with mean ± SD age of 36±4.7 yr and 76.4% being female recruited. Pediatricians had significantly higher encounter with autistic patients (18% vs. 10%, P-value=0.06) and parents of autistic child (17% vs. 12%, P-value=0.07). But generally, 209 participants (98.6%) declared that they were familiar with autism. There was no statistically significant difference between study groups in rating DSM-IV TR criteria for ASD as “necessary for diagnosis”. Age, gender and working experience, did not differ between pediatricians or HCW answers (all P-values >0.05). Among HCW participants, higher educational level was associated with higher disagreement about “autistic children is schizophrenic” (P=0.01). Moreover, HCW with higher working experience had higher agreement rate with “autistic children needs special education” statement (P= 0.04).</p>
       <br><br>
            <h3 id="uside">Conclusion</h3> 
            <p id="side">
            There are still misconceptions about ASD regarding developmental, cognitive and emotional features in both HCW and pediatricians needed to be educated through national program.
