    <h1>THERAPY FOR AUTISM AND ADHD</h1><br>
    <p>
        <h2>Therapies that can help with Autism :</h2>
        A number of therapies can help people with autism improve their abilities and reduce their symptoms.<br>
        Starting therapy early during preschool or before improves the chances for your child’s success<br><br>
        <b><u>Play Therapy:</u></b><br>
        Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), playing is the way they express themselves their toys and their actions may become their words.<br> 
        Play can help children with ASD learn and connect with other people, both children and adults, in a way they understand.
        Play therapy can improve their social and emotional skills, help them think in different ways, add to their language or
        communication skills, and expand the ways they play with toys and relate to other people.<br>
        <b><u>Occupational Therapy:</u></b><br>
         Occupational  therapy helps with activities of daily living and the use of everyday objects,
        like learning to button a shirt or hold a fork the right way.<br> But it can involve anything related to school,
         work, or play. <br>The focus depends on the child’s needs and goals.</b>The overall goal of occupational therapy is to help people with autism improve their quality of life at home and in school.
        The therapist helps introduce, keep up, and improve skills so people with autism can be as independent as possible.<br>
        <b><u>Speech Therapy:</u></b><br>
            People with ASD may have major problems with both speech and nonverbal communication. 
            They may also find it very hard to interact socially. For these reasons, speech therapy is a central part of treatment for autism. It helps children with speaking, as well as communicating and interacting with others. 
            It can involve nonverbal skills, like making eye contact, taking turns in a conversation, and using and understanding gestures. 
            Once autism is diagnosed, speech therapists figure out the best ways to improve communication.
            The speech-language pathologist works closely with the family, school, and other professionals.
            Speech therapy can improve overall communication. This makes it possible for people with autism to improve their ability to form relationships and function in day-to-day life.
            Specific goals of speech therapy include helping the individual with autism such as
            Articulate words well,
            communicate both verbally and nonverbally,
            understand verbal and nonverbal communication, and what other people mean in different settings and
            start communication without prompting from others<br><br>
     <h2>Therapies that can help with ADHD:</h2><br>
     <b><u>Behavioral Therapy:</u></b><br>
     Behavioral therapy can help people with ADHD learn skills that control their symptoms and help them manage tasks. 
     The goal of behavioral therapy is to replace negative behaviors with positive ones. 
     Behavioral therapy does this by teaching strategies to improve problem areas like organization, focus, and impulse control.
     Behavioral therapy for children with ADHD takes a whole family approach to change behaviors. 
     All behavioral therapy focuses on changing a person’s actions.<br>
     Children will learn new skills and new ways to manage tasks that might be challenging for them, such as completing homework,
     paying attention in class ,keeping their rooms clean and completing any daily chores.
